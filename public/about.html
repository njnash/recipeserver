      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
      Audrey’s Great Big Book of Food is a compilation of all of the recipes I have enjoyed making over the years. I have obtained these recipes in many different ways, from family, friends, cookbooks, magazines, and restaurants, just to name a few.
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
      The idea for this book started in about 2001 when I had so many recipes, in so many different places, it became difficult to find recipes I was looking for. I photocopied all of my favorite recipes and placed them in a three-ring binder, divided by categories. Natalie, drew and colored, the now famous, original artwork for the binder. Thus, Audrey’s Great Big Book of Food was created!

      Moving forward to 2015, after adding many more recipes to the book, it also had become too large to deal with.  Rich and I were discussing my ‘cookbook problem’ on a walk one day. We developed the idea of having an online version of the book, that could be accessed from any computer, tablet, or phone. This allowed for much more flexibility because recipes could be categorized for searches in unlimited ways. Rich wrote the program for this amazing recipe website and I typed in all of the recipes. A photo of all of the recipes are included. I have not been taking pictures of my recipes all along, so many of the photos are stock-photos; I am replacing them with my own photos as I go.

      On February 14th, 2016,  Audrey’s Great Big Book of Food, the digital edition is ready! I will continue to add new recipes and improve old ones along the way. I hope that you enjoy the cookbook, please let me know if you have any <a href="/comment">questions or comments</a>.
