    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Audrey's Great Big Book of Food was started around 1997 when Audrey decided to organize
      her vast collection of recipes into one large binder. The book consists only of recipes
      that Audrey actually made herself, and proved to be good enough to make the book. Over the years
      the book grew to be 5 inches thick and has many wonderful foods and drinks. However its
      size was also a drawback.
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Audrey always dreamed of being able to find recipes in a number of ways. If she had a
      particular ingredient available, or was planning a party for a particular holiday, or any
      number of other criteria. A paper book simply could not provide that sort of organization.
      So, this website was created. Rich, taking input from Audrey's ideas, wrote a web application
      to allow Audrey to enter all of her recipes online, and the web application could do the
      categorization and free form searching she wanted.
